This project involved building a ray tracing program, which generates 3D scenes based on user input. The base functionality supports rendering spheres, planes, cones, and cylinders, with added bonus features for transparency, refraction, and reflection.

## Key Features
- Ray tracing for 3D rendering
- Support for basic shapes (sphere, plane, cone, cylinder)
- Advanced features including transparency, refraction, and reflection
- Real-time rendering with MLX for graphical output

## Getting Started

### Building the Project
To compile the project, run:
```bash
make
```

To compile the bonus version with transparency, refraction, and reflection:
```bash
make bonus
```

This will generate an executable file:
- `miniRT` for the basic version.
- `miniRT_bonus` for the bonus version.

### Launching the Program
To run the RayTracer:
```bash
./miniRT [scene_file.rt]
```
Replace `[scene_file.rt]` with the path to your .rt scene file.

For the bonus version with reflection, refraction, and transparency:
```bash
./miniRT_bonus scene_file.rt
```

### Clean Up
To clean up object files and the executable:
```bash
make clean
```
To remove all files generated during the build (including executables):
```bash
make fclean
```

### Launch with Valgrind and Suppressions
To run the program with Valgrind and suppressions, use the following command:
```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=suppression/miniRT.supp ./miniRT
```

## Challenges

1. **Complex Parsing Logic**
   Parsing scene descriptions (lights, shapes, and camera settings) was a significant challenge. The input format had to be processed efficiently while maintaining flexibility for additional features in the bonus part. Special attention was required for error handling, ensuring incorrect input was properly managed without crashes.

2. **Cone and Cylinder Intersections**
   Handling intersections for cones and cylinders required solving complex mathematical equations. Ensuring precise ray-object intersections was particularly difficult due to floating-point precision issues and edge cases where rays would skim along the object’s surface.

3. **Recursive Ray Tracing for Reflection and Refraction**
   Implementing reflection and refraction required recursive ray tracing, where each reflected or refracted ray spawns new rays. Managing recursion depth while maintaining performance was crucial to prevent infinite loops or excessive computation.

4. **Transparency and Light Behavior**
   Simulating transparent materials required tracking multiple light paths as rays passed through different materials, leading to additional complexity in calculations. Handling refraction indices and light bending realistically without distorting performance was a challenge.

5. **MLX42 and Graphics Rendering**
   Connecting the mathematical model to MLX42 required efficient integration between rendering logic and low-level image buffers. Handling graphical updates efficiently ensured smooth rendering.

6. **Optimization**
   Despite using a single-threaded approach, we optimized performance to achieve fast rendering speeds. Key improvements included:
   - Minimized Memory Allocations: Eliminated unnecessary memory allocations to reduce overhead.
   - Avoided Extra Libraries: Kept dependencies minimal for better performance control.
   - Reduced System Calls: Optimized file handling and rendering by minimizing expensive system calls to the kernel.
   - Loop Optimization: Refactored loops to remove redundant computations.
   - Efficient Math Operations: Optimized matrix and vector calculations to improve performance.

As a result, we achieved high-speed rendering without sacrificing quality, even when handling complex scenes.
